# Network Everything

Journal #1 : 23 Jan 2018: (Response to Linked, Chapters 1-3)


    Chapter 2, especially, gave me multiples of flashbacks of instances I have been exposed to graph theory. Not only it was a unit of Discrete Mathematics, I seldom randomly watch documentaries or read articles about graph theory and its applications. One of my favorites was using graph theory to increase the efficiency of kidney transplant; the inefficiency primarily rises from mismatch of willing donor's kidney and the patient's. Dr. Sommer Gentry proposed a creation of a network of other donor-patient mismatch to result in more matches. Whether it'd be called "percolation" or "community", connecting pair of nodes together and creating a network does indeed form something special. Often times, the "giant cluster" may even save lives like the kidney network. <br /><br />
    I admit that there exists a "giant cluster", which may or may not benefit people. But, I am a little bit skeptical on how nodes are holding up this cluster. Honestly, it sounds too good to be true. I mean, often cases, whenever I go on the wikepedia rabbit hole, I don't necessarily go back to my initial topic after hopping between pages. Okay, to be fair, this may not be a clear network afterall. The party example is comparable to Facebook. Although there are freakish coincidences of finding friends with mutual friends of a completely different set ups, I don't think that is sufficient to prove anything. The passing the letter example was amusing, but after six degrees of separation, can you say there is a strong enough connection to claim anything? can you actually say you "know" the person? Network exists, but as a simple node in the equation, it is not easy to visualize the bigger picture of the connected world and the connected web. <br />
